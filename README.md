# Diagnostic scripts for evaluating land-atmosphere interactions in climate models. 

Author: Jess Baker (j.c.baker@leeds.ac.uk) 

The scripts in this repository were developed as part of CSSP Brazil LAPSE project at the University of Leeds, UK and accompany the following manuscript:

Baker, J.C.A, Castilho de Souza, D., Andrews, M.B., Kubota, P., Buermann, W., Coelho, C.A.S., Gloor, M., Garcia-Carreras, L., Marsham, J.H., Figueroa, S.N. and Spracklen, D.V. (in prep) Land-atmosphere moisture coupling over South America in simulations from the UK and Brazil climate models.

Diagnostic scripts:
- terrestrial_coupling_index.py
- zengs_gamma.py
- T_ET_metric.py
- betts_approach.py
- two_legged_metric.py

Script providing examples of applying each diagnostic:
- examples_of_application.py

These scripts are largely based on the Iris Python package (https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/)and are designed to be run with observations and model output in NetCDF format.
