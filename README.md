Diagnostic scripts:
- terrestrial_coupling_index.py
- zengs_gamma.py
- T_ET_metric.py
- betts_approach.py
- two_legged_metric.py

Script providing examples of applying each diagnostic:
- examples_of_application.py

These scripts are largely based on the Iris Python package (https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/)and are designed to be run with observations and model output in NetCDF format.
